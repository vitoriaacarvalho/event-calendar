## 🚀 Description
- Event Management Project: I started this one thinking about my group of friends and how we're always scheduling new events/parties and every single one has to have a whatsapp group of some kind to organize the event.
  In this code, the user can create an event, invite friends, send email notifications for the event, tag the event and search by tags.
  Even send a document (such as a pdf with dress-code examples or food menus) and spotify playlist link when wanted.
  I also wanted to showcase my quality/clean/organized code skills + add a few technologies such as AWS to be a good portfolio project!
